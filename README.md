## 🧩 How It Works

- Always includes at least **one letter**
- If **"Include Numbers"** is checked → adds at least **one number**
- If **"Include Special Characters"** is checked → adds at least **one symbol**
- The rest of the password is filled with random characters from the allowed set
- Characters are shuffled to avoid predictable order
